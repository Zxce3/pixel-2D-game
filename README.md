# Pixel 2D Game

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5109c1f-ef24-4f82-b953-6e69d39e74fa



A simple 2D pixel game created for learning and experimentation purposes using SvelteKit and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental game development techniques by building a 2D side-scrolling game. The player can move, jump, and experience physics-based movement and collision detection, with immersive animations and parallax scrolling background layers to enhance the visual experience.

## Key Features

- **Player Movement**: The player can move left, right, and jump. Movement includes velocity and momentum, simulating realistic physics, with collision detection to prevent the player from moving outside the game bounds.
  
- **Player Animations**: The player has animations for different states: idle, running, jumping, and falling, with frame-based sprite handling for smooth transitions.
  
- **Keyboard Controls**: Player movement is controlled through arrow keys (`←` and `→` for left and right) and spacebar for jumping. The game responds fluidly to keyboard input with physics applied to the player's actions.

## Technologies Used

- **SvelteKit**: The game is built using SvelteKit, a modern framework for building web applications with Svelte.
- **JavaScript**: The game logic is written in JavaScript, handling player movement, animations, collision detection, and background scrolling.

## Future Improvements

- Adding new levels with varied challenges and environments.
- Implementing enemies and other obstacles for the player to avoid or overcome.
- Sound effects and background music for enhanced immersion.
- A score system to track the player's progress.
